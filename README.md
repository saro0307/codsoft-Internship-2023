# JOI Chatbot

## Description
This is a simple Python chatbot program that responds to user input based on predefined rules. The chatbot uses a set of rules and responses to generate replies. It's designed to engage in basic conversations and provide default responses when specific rules are not matched.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `chatbot.py` file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory where the `chatbot.py` file is located.
5. Run the program using the command: `python chatbot.py`

The chatbot will initiate a conversation, and you can type your messages to interact with it. To exit the chat, simply type 'bye.'

## Predefined Rules and Responses
The chatbot recognizes specific rules and provides corresponding responses. Here are some examples:

- **Greetings:**
  - Input: "hello"
  - Response: Random greeting from ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Hey!"]

- **Inquiry about well-being:**
  - Input: "how are you"
  - Response: Random response from ["I'm just a chatbot.", "I don't have feelings, but I'm here to help."]

- **Name inquiry:**
  - Input: "what's your name"
  - Response: "You can call me JOI."

- **Farewell:**
  - Input: "bye"
  - Response: Random farewell message from ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Bye!"]

- **Default responses:**
  - If no specific rule matches, the chatbot provides a default response from ["I'm not sure I understand.", "Can you please rephrase that?", "I don't have an answer for that."]
